1) Mutex locks and unlocks threads during concurrent operations.

Allows for sharing between resources.

2) Because each thread has it's own indivisible resources, thus each
mutex is atomic. It can only be accessed this way.

3) If a thread alread is locked by mutex and tries to lock again
it will enter deadlock. This is because no other thread can unlock
mutex.
