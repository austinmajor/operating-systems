semaphore

2) If no parent waiting, process is a zombie

	A process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet called wait(), is known as a zombie process. 
	
	All processes transition to this state when they terminate, but generally they exist as zombies only briefly. 
	
Once the parent calls wait(), the process identifier of the zombie process and its entry in the process table are released.
